            <h2>Saab's History</h2>
            <p>In 1945, the Swedish Aerospace and defence company, Saab, designed their first automobile. in 1949 they
            released
            the Saab 92, They continued to have success and in 1968 merged with Scania-Vabis, a decade later they
            released
            their best selling model, The 900. This car had many quirks and features that enticed buyers, selling a
            total of
            ~909,000 units. In 1989, Saab-Scania was restructured and General Motors took a 50% stake the company.
            during
            this period Saab released the 9-3 and the 9-5 models, some of the more well known Saab cars. In 2010 GM
            decided
            to sell Saab, there were a few options, inlcuding Koenigsegg, a company now known for some of the fastest
            cars
            in the world, like the Agera, Regera, Jesko, and others. However, Spyker Cars was the final buyer. After
            many
            years of making innovative cars and building their brand, they eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2011, and
            by June of 2012, they had sold all of factories and manufacturing rights to the new company NEVS
            (National Electric Vehicle Sweden). NEVS tried to start making the Saab cars again but lost the rights to
            the
            Saab name, still owned by the Saab Aerospace company that is still alive today, and instead began making
            electric
            cars based on the 9-3 model, but under their own company name. Saab has a rich history of innovation in
            quality,
            speed, comfort, efficiency, safety, and more. Unfortuntely they were unable to grow enough of a following
            and after
            a few questionable years, were forced into bankruptcy.</p>

            <h2>My Saab</h2>
            <p>
            My very first car was a 2008 9-3, It isn't the fastest car, or the most luxurious. But it had comfortable
            seats, a funny cupholder that always made for a fun party trick, a great turbo sound, a manual transmission,
            and many features that many low to mid tier cars today don't even have. I've grown to love that car and will
            always feel a special attachment to the Saab brand.
