                destractions from the dash.</li>
            <li>In order to increase safety and improve design, Saab created a compact cupholder that is stored in the
                dash and flips out when pressed.</li>
            <li>Similar to aircrafts, Saab cars had the ignition port between the driver's and passenger's seats. They
                claim this design is more ergonomic, and is easy to use do to being close to the gearshift and
                handbrake.</li>
            <li>Saab was one of the most innovative brands, they pioneered turbocharged engines with good fuel economy,
                had many safety and quality-of-life features that made the driving experience much safer and smoother,
